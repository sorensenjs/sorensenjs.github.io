Working for a startup is famously all about burning the candle at both ends with long hours and, 
usually, a string of emergencies each more urgent than whatever it is you are working on. 
Working for the government is like being bogged down in bureaucracy and trapped in amber. 
Now imagine a flame trapped in amber - this the story of 
[_Dark Wire_](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/joseph-cox/dark-wire/9781541702691/?lens=publicaffairs) 
about the FBI run cellular 
phone network for criminals. Every security feature was compromised from tip to tail.

I had to turn my tinfoil hat inside out to contain my mind being blown. 
You almost start to feel sorry for the hapless criminals who were betrayed by technology - 
but not quite. It's a hell of a story that deserves more attention.
