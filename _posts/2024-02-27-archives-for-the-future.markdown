A recent Wikimedia Foundation [blog post](https://diff.wikimedia.org/2024/02/19/communicating-diversity-links-between-journalism-and-the-wikimedia-universe/)
described the work of a Chilean collective of journalists who dispense with the noise of 
"what's news" and instead use their time and resource to investigate stories and
"to begin the narratives of that which we will see in the future as an archive."
What seems like a novel approach actually is a return to the roots of journalism.
Especially if you consider that even though journalism is laser focused on *now*
it still ends up missing important stories that are right under our nose.

Two books that I read recently seem like great examples of stories that have been
going on for the last 20 years that you likely know little about.

The first book is [The Sleeping Beauties And Other Stories of Mystery Illness](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/23/books/review/the-sleeping-beauties-suzanne-osullivan.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Y00.c_rm.k3vzkhVltgaF&smid=url-share)
By Suzanne Oâ€™Sullivan. This book is quite disturbing as the author travels the world
meeting and treating people who suffer from an array of illnesses. Many of these are
what people call "psychosomatic" illnesses, but this carries a stigma that the problem
is imagined, or is somehow the fault of the sufferer. What becomes increasingly clear through
Suzanne's work is that these illnesses are inflicted upon people by others in their social
context. Sometimes by their own parents who are simultaneously fighting
ceaselessly against doctors and governments. The news portion is the section of the book
discussing the [Havanna Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana_syndrome) - an
embarassing failure of both the medical and journalistic establishments. Despite the simple
fact that there is no plausible means of building a sonic or electromagnetic weapon that could
affect only specific people in a building as large as an embassy, the focus of the reporting
was on "how could the Russians have done this?"

The second book [The Hank Show](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/04/books/review/the-hank-show-mckenzie-funk.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Y00.DM_F.KWdFNax-ZwsZ&smid=url-share)
by McKenzie Funk about the unlikely protagonist Hank Asher. A Tony Soprano-esque figure who
was a drug smuggler and a violent boss but who managed, during his career to launch what
became multi-billion dollar data broker firms no less than three times. It's a story that
anticipates Kashmir Hill's [Your Face Belongs To Us](https://www.simonandschuster.co.uk/books/Your-Face-Belongs-to-Us/Kashmir-Hill/9781398509177).
It explains how sunshine laws were exploited to build the commercial data now aggregated
by credit bureaus and sold back to law enforcement. There's the familiar themes of the
hacker ethos, but the most surprising part of this story is that its utterly unknown.
Hank is like a Forest Gump of the world of PCs, and an impressive array of famous names
are there in the book trying to figure how to exploit his technology without ever
being associated with or paying him.
