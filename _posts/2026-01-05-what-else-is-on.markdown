Park Chan-wook tries to unscamble Sartre to get satire, but something is missing. This grim
fable repeatedly evoked for me other (and maybe better) films like 
_The Last Seduction_ and _Jean de Florette_ and the 
[writing of Ted Chiang](https://www.newyorker.com/science/annals-of-artificial-intelligence/will-ai-become-the-new-mckinsey).

That said, as AI turns toxic in the public's eye,
I think this film might be establishing the leitmotif of the
latter half of this decade. Science fiction has always approached robots and advance machines
as an _other_ that we ourselves have created. And, as with _Terminator_ it is usually
portreyed as something that will bring us together and bring out the best in humanity.

But this film suggests otherwise - that technology is going to amplify our worst impulses
in us, as humans turn on one another in competition for the last remaining job.
Bleak and a little hilarious.
